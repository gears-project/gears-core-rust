[REQ-artifact-testing]
text = '''
As part of the artifact generation, suitable testing artifacts shall be
generated to assert the validity of the assumptions made in the artifact
generation. E.g. Selenium tests for browser-based artifacts.

[REQ-domain]
text = '''
A platform independent format for describing a data model shall be available.

[REQ-dsl]
text = '''
Each data structure in the project shall be open to manipulation and inspection
via a consistent, declarative, domain-specific, textual language.
'''

[REQ-flox]
text = '''
An evaluation environment shall be available with an expression-based language
capable of,

 - Performing numeric arithmetic
 - Performing boolean arithmetic
 - Binding to contextual variables at run-time
'''

[REQ-i18n]
text = '''

All user-facing text will be translatable into an arbitrary number of
languages, identified by ISO 639-2 code, optionally extended with a regional
code identified with a two-letter country code from ISO-3166-2.

[REQ-portability]
text = '''

 - The project shall be available for a wide variety of operating systems and platforms.
 - The project shall be suitable for embedding in other environments.

[REQ-purpose]
text = '''
The purpose of this project is to provide data structures and tooling for the
manipulation and execution of a portable representation (model) of an
application containing,

 - a data model (domain)
 - user interfaces (ui)
 - state transisitions (app-flow)
 - validations (using xflow)
 - graph-based execution (xflow)
 - an evaluation language (flox)
 - internationalization (i18n)

All aspects of the model shall be serializable to and deserializable from
multiple formats as well as having a plain-text, filesystem-based
representation suitable for management under a version-control system.

All aspects of the model manipulation and artifact generation shall be suitable
for integration in existing build-pipelines and development processes.

Examples can be found in {repo}/resources/

'''

[REQ-serialization]
text = '''
Flows shall be serialized and deserialized in different formats.

Serialization and deserialization shall be possible with,
 - json
 - yaml

'''

[REQ-serialization-fs]
text = '''
All models can be serialized to or deserialized from a filesystem. The
filesystem format shall,

 - Have a separate file for each document in the model
 - Be human readable (indented output, not compact)
 - Be suitable for management by a version control system
'''

[REQ-serialization-json]
text = '''
All models can be serialized to or deserialized from JSON.
'''

[REQ-serialization-yaml]
text = '''
All models can be serialized to or deserialized from YAML.
'''

[REQ-xflow]
text = '''
A graph-based, platform independent format for describing logic shall be available.

The format shall be suitable for, amongst others,

 - Graph analysis
 - Graph rendering
'''

[REQ-xflow-call]
text = '''
An xflow shall be able to call another xflow.
